Please use the Import Data option in MySQL Workbench. Don't forget to double click the database to make it functional (left panel).

The Queries are loaded as tabs to call the procedures, and also the view. The procedures are stored in the left tree-menu in the Database option.

Also, some screen captures are included with the tasks proposed, and short files with each requirement for the queries, procedures and statements.

For the Tableau excercise, folders are provided with the Tableau file and also there is a folder with screen captures in case your Tableau is a demo and is already expired.

A .sql backup data-only file is provided also (without table fillings).

Also a .pdf file as a reference is included, in case you want to see all the procedures and results in my machine, and a all-in-one document of all the tasks.



The database password is: R0drig0# in case it is required.
